This is a training curriculum teaching good practices in lesson design and development,
and open source collaboration skills. This is a modified version of the Carpentries Collaborative Lesson Development Training used for UCLA-IMLS Open Science for Librarians project.

We believe that lesson development is easier and more successful when it is a joint effort among collaborators, so the activities and examples used in this training are best suited to groups of trainees who want to collaborate on a lesson project.
Efforts have been made to also cater to lesson developers working alone.

## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:
  
- identify and characterise the target audience for a lesson.
- define SMART learning objectives.
- explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks.
- create exercises for formative assessment.
- explain how considerations of cognitive load can influence the pacing, length, and organisation of a lesson.

## Optional material  

- configure and maintain accessible and usable lesson repositories using best practices, readily available for collaboration.
- identify and correct accessibility issues in a Carpentries lesson.
- update and improve lesson material guided by feedback and reflection from teaching.
- review and provide constructive feedback on lessons.
- collaboratively develop and publish lessons using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure (aka [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]): lesson template, GitHub, GitHub Pages, etc.
